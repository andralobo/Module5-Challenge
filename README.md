# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the PyBer Analysis
### Purpose
The purpose of this Analysis is to create a summary of the ride-sharing app PyBer.  The data from January to May 2019 will be used to create compelling visualizations for the CEO, V. Isualize.

There will be sets of data provided to run our analysis, city data and ride data.  The two will be merged to run analysis and by City type to determine  

Matplotlib is a graphing a plotting library for Python and will be used with Jupyter Notebook to create Visualizations.


## PyBer Analysis Results

With the data provided the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver we calculated using the count, sum and mean functions along with groupby, pivot, resample and loc functions.

The PyBer Summary chart below shows that Urban cities have the highest number of total rides, total drivers, and generates the highest in total fares.  But their average fare per ride and average fare per driver is significantly lower. The Rural cities have the lowest Number of rides, drivers and generated the least amount of revenue.  Though their fares are much higher than Suburban and Urban cities.

The graph below shows the difference in total fares by city type for January to May 2019.  Urban cities generate a significantly higher amount in total fares even with the lower cost per ride because the volume is so much higher.

## PyBer Analysis Summary
I would recommend doing this analysis with more data.  The data for this analysis was only for 5 months and having data for an entire year we would be able to see which months perform better than others. Having information on the riders like their age and gender and the number of riders per ride we would be able to provide visualizations on those demographics.  We have the fare total, but we don't know how many miles there are per trip.  Being able to calculate the fare/mile could possibly show why the fares in Rural and Suburban cities are so high.

I wood recommend that PyBer focus on growing the Rural and Suburban cities to see how they can increase the number of rides.
